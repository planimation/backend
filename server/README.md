+ Heroku CLI

# Create Heroku Project
After installing heroku, first login with your heroku account in terminal/console:
`heroku login`
 then create an empty heroku project:
`heroku create`
Heroku will create random name directory for the project
`cd [project_name]`
and set the buildpack environment for python:
`heroku buildpacks:set heroku/python`
at last, move your django files to this directory 

# Deploy Project on Heroku
Now the project is setup, the next step is deploying it to heroku.
We need to have two documents:
+ `requirements.txt`
+ `Procfile`(no .extend)

`requirments.txt` is telling heroku what should be installed for the deployment server, it can simply generated by calling `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
we need to have two extra package for our project to run, adding the following lines in `requirments.txt`:
`django-cors-headers==2.4.0`
`gunicorn==19.7.1`

`Procfile` is telling what the deployment server will automatlly run:
`web: gunicorn [servername].wsgi --log-file -`
the [servername] is the name of the django project, it is named `server` in our project.

Heroku is using git to publish, so next, we will need to add all our change in the heroku project and commit them.
`git add *`
`git commit -m "deploy project"`
then we will push to heroku master branch:
`git push heroku master`
